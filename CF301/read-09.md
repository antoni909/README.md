[Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

What is functional programming?
A: it is a way of thinking when programming, and it consists of:
  - pure functions
  - immutability
  - referential transparency

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
A: it will return the same result if given the same arguments(it uses arguments that were not passed as params)

What are the benefits of a pure function?
A: they are stable, consistent and predictable

What is immutability?
A: will not change and cannot change over time

What is Referential transparency?
A: when a function consistently returns the same result for the same input, so given the same input it will result in the same output no matter how many times the function is ran

## An Introduction to Node.JS from sitepoint.com

- What is node and when to use it?
 built on google chromes V8 js engine, this allows for JavaScript to be run on our computers, this is called JavaScript runtime

- How to install Node and using npm

  - Node Binaries versus Version Manager
  version manager allows you to install multiple versions of Node to allow you to switch between them seemlessly.
  
  - node --version
  tells you what version of node is on computer

  - node has support for ES6 and over allowing you to use the latest/modern JS syntax, such as template liters, object destructure, new array methods, etc

  - Installing:
    - npm install -g jshint  this installs globally
    - npm init -y            this installs locally

  - Working with package.json files
    - node_modules is a folder where npm saves lodash and lodash dependencies
    - [npm how-to for beginners](https://www.sitepoint.com/npm-guide/)

- What is node used for?

  - node with npm are used to automate the process of developing js apps
    - npm for install
    - node for building tools
  
  - build tools that bundle js files/dependencies to static assets, run tests, automatic linting, style check etc.

- Node.js on the server and its Execution Model

  - Node runs single thread
  - The Execution
    1. Node apps pass (async tasks + callback) to event loop
    2. event loop manages "thread pool" and executes tasks
    3. event loop executes each callback as tasks get completed

- Downsides?
  - blcoking I/O calls should be avoided
  - errors should be handled correctly
  - call back are messy
    - Solution to this are Promises and Asynch Await

- Running a Server using Node:
  - uses Node's native HTTP module + createServer() method of that module
  - this creates a new web-based server OBJECT
  - this object passes anonymous function that is invoked for every NEW connection made on the serverf
    - anonnymous funciton called using request and response arguments
  - Tell the server to listen to incoming requests on PORT 3000

    - [tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/build-a-simple-web-server-with-node-js/)

- What apps work best with node ?

  - real time interaction/collaboration
    - chat sites, handling mulitple requests, data streaming
  - [build/structure a NODE APP](https://www.sitepoint.com/node-js-mvc-application/)

- Advantages of Node.js
  - speed
  - scalability
  - same language front and back, server and client
  - speaks JSON
  - ubiquitous

## Axios

- Features
  - make XML HTTP requests from browser or node.js
  - supports Promise API
  - intercepts or transforms or cancel requests/response
  - automatic transforms to JSON data formata
  - Support for protecting against XSRF

- Installing
  - using npm
    npm install axios
  - using jsDelivr CDN
    \<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
  
- Example usage
  - retrive axios and its methods using require method
    \const axios = require('default').default;
  
  - Performing GET request
    - make a request for a user with a given ID

      \axios.get('/user',{
        params: { 
          id: 12345
         }
      })
      .then( function(response){ console.log('response');} )
      .catch( function(error){ console.log( 'error' ); } )
      .then( function(){ //code here will always execute })
      };
      - OR make a request using async await instead

        \async function getUser(){
          try{
            const response = await axios.get('/user?id=12345');
            console.log(response);
          } catch (errror) {
            console.log(errror);
          }
        }

  - Performing a Post Request
  - Performing Multiple Requests

- Axios API
  - requests can be made by passing relavent configs to axios
- Request Config
  - there are availble options for making requests where only the URL is needed
  - requests default to GET if method is not specified



## (source: MDN) Asynchronous Programming using Asynch and Await

- Basics of Asynch and Await

  - to turn into an async function the async keyword is placed in front of a function declaration and this means that it is expecting the await keyword too.
  - async functions return values are guaranteed to ve converted to Promises
  - can use arrow function notation
  - the .then() is used to "consume" the return value of promises
  - async tells functions to return a promise RATHER than a direct value
  - await keywork only works with async functions

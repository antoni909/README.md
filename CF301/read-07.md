## On the Reading: ["A conversation about REST with my brother"]((https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550))

- REST: is a architectural style on which the web is based on and it provides a definition of a resource

- URLs: tell the browser that there is a 'resource' somewhere

- redirect: 

- Polymorphism: different nouns can have the same verb applied to them (noun is the thing, verb is what you can DO to that thing)

- Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH.

## API Keys

Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.

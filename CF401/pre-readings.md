## Solving Problems

from the reading: [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

Paraphrasing the Reading:

Most common mistake is the improper allocation of time

Steps to Follow:

- Read the Entire Problem 2x
  - make sure you understand the problem and what is being asked
- Solve Manually with 3 sample Data
  - solve manually so you know what needs to be automated
  - best way to test case your solution (1,2,n...)
  - write out what you are 'storing' in your head
- Optimize Manual Steps
  - best to do in the base-case where it is most malleable
- Write Steps as comments/pseudo code
  - capture all the steps created to manually solve the problem
- Replace with Real Code
  - will be a 1-for-1 translation at this point
- Optimize Real Code
  - have good names for variables and functions
  - DRY

Practice this process of Solving Coding Challenges

## Act like you make $1000/hr

from the reading: [Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d)

Note: Medium wants me to upgrade in order to read the article. I dont want to pay to upgrade.

## How to think like a programmer

from the reading: [How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

Paraphrasing the Reading:

Typical approach to problem solving when programming

1. try solution
1. if didn't work try another solution
1. repeat until successful

Down side to this approach is that it is a huge waste of time

How to Fix this approach:

- Have a Framework / Set of principles to guide your thinking

Steps:

1. Understand

- you understand the problem when you can explain it simply

1. Plan

- Analyze the proble and process the info

1. Devide (using: Reduce the Problem Technique)

- Break down the problem into sub-problems
- Sub-problems will be mutually exclusive

1. Stuck?

- be curious about the errors/bugs not irritated
- Debug: find where you went wrong
  - the computer does exactly what you tell it to do, what did you think you told it to do?
- Reassess:
  - try another perspective
  - is there a more general approach?
- Start new if you must
- Research using Google-foo

1. Practice

## The 5 Whys

from the reading: [5 Whys Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

Paraphrasing from the Reading:

 The 5 'Whys' are used to thread multiple reasons for a specific problem and allows you to explore each respectively to its root cause where you can resolve the issue and moniter with appropriate measures.

PreWork - Videos

from the video: [What the heck is the event loop anyway? | Philip Roberts | JSConf EU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

Brief Summary from video:

It is the job of the Event loop to moniter the Task Queue(Callback Queue) and MicroTask Queue with the JS Callstack so that WebApis(console.logs(), fetch(), setTimeout(), etc), CallBacks, Promises can be fed into the Callstack in the order they are completed in the Browswer and pushed into their corresponding Queue.

from the video: [The Super Mario effect. Tricking your brain into learning more. Mark Rober. TedxPenn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mClJBTz9I6U)

Brief Summary from video:

  Basically, dont be ashamed of not reaching your goal in the first try. Learn from the mistakes made of not reaching your goal and try again, however many times necessary unitl the goal is reached.

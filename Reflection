# *Reflection*

**Perhaps the biggest lesson I took away from my first intercation with github and creating my first repository is how simple and easy 
the markdown format is to use and interact with compared to using a text editor and having to use HTML/CSS. I have also loearned that 
GitHub is an open source community that all level of developers use to create and contribute to repositories. I have learned the basic 
concepts of Markdown format such as Headings (use #, where the number of characters represents the level of heading), itilics vs bold 
(using * symbol), and other key concepts such as lists, links, images, headers and quotes.** 

**This class forced me to push beyond these basic concepts by creating a live site using Github and all the tools it has to offer such 
creating repositories, editing repositories by using Markdown language to format a website, using templates that could be used to theme
website created on Github. This is a very brief introduction on what can be done on Github and the beauty of Markdown formatting.** 

# Markdown Examples:

1. H1 level headers use: #H1
2. H2 level headers use: ##h2
3. H3 level headers use: ###h3

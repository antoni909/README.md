# This page is a response to reading assignment pertaining to Computer Architecture and Logic

## This assignment required us to watch a series of videos that explained how computers work. Covering topics from what makes a computer all the way up to the software and hardware of a computer.

**Computers are designed to manipulate information and they must perform four diffent task:**

 1. - input: there are different types of input to inlcude: audio, video, physical, electronic etc..
 2. - storage: all those inputs are stored in Memory
 3. - process: (CPU) takes info from storage and process the information with algorithems
 4. - output: are then returned to the user

**Wires and Circuits carry all the informaiton inside a computer. With one wire that runs electricity through it you can create a bit. This will allow you to create an on/off state,yes/no, true/false or a 1/0. Using the binary system, any number can be represented via 1 and 0. Text, images, and sound can be represented with ones and zeros, or on/off electrical signals**

**Simple Circuit takes and electrical signal and flips it. There are many circuits that perform easy and complex logic to increase the sophistication of a circuit. All the information processing done by a computer are done by simple circuits and these simple ideas**

**Hardware are all the physical components that are found on a computer. The software is all the computer programs and code running on the computer. The CPU will recieve commmands via binary that tell it what circuit will be used. Those sequence of commands are what are known as code. Hardware tells the software what to do. The operating system of a computer is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of the computer.**

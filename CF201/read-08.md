1. CSS Positioning
    1. Two types of Elements: Block-level and inline
        1. Block Elements
            1. If one block sits inside another block, the container block is the parent
    1. Controlling Positioning using Schemes
        1. Normal Flow - default behavior; all block levels elements start new line
        1. Relative Flow - shifts to specified direction(up,down,left,right) and removes it from normal flow, other elements remain normal flow
        1. Absolute Flow - relative to containing element, doesn’t affect other elements flow
            1. Fixed Positioning - form of abs pos because it is relative to browser window and not container element
        1. Floating Elements - become block elements around which content can flow
    1. Z - Index - allows you to control which box appears on top it's like the bring to the front or send to the back feature
1. Layout Grids
    1. 960 Pixel Grid and 12 Column Grid Layout
        1. Page Wide = 960 px
        1. 12 Columns = 60 px
            1. Column Margin = 10 px (only 1 column margins per page)
            1. Column Gaps = 20 px
1. Adding Multiple Style Sheets to CSS DOC
    1. @import Rule - allows you add css styling via url’s

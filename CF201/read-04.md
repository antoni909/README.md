## JavaScript Chapter 3: Functions, Methods and Objects

## Summary Type: Notes in Outline Form

### Functions let you contain a series of statements that have been grouped together to perform a specific task. 

1. Functions
-Call: when you invoke/call the function to perform its task
-Parameter: pieces of information passed to the function
-Return: is the answer you expect the funciton to give you, a response
-Declaring: use the following syntax: function functionName() {code block} to call the funtion: functionName();
-Arguments as Values vs Arguments as Variable
  - Args as Vals: you specify the value of the parameter of a function using arguments
  -Args as Vars: you dont have to specify the value when calling a function, you can use variables in their place
-Multiple Vals out of a Function
  - functions can return more than one value using an array
1. Function Expressions when a browswer expects to see an expression then it will treat it as an expression
  -Immediately Invoke Func Expressions
    -use the following syntax: 
    var name = (function() {code block}()); where the () after the code block is called the final parenthesis and it tells the interpretter to call the funtion immediately
    -the grouping order paranthesis, enase the entire code, ensure the interpretter treats it as a function expresssion
1. Variable Scope
  -Local Varibles: are function level or local vars useable only inside function
  -Global Variables: vars that can be used outsind/inside local/funtions
    -use more memory than local vars
    -naming conflicts arise vs none with local vars

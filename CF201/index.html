Nonetheless the article element should be conceptually independent from the figure element, this is to say that the article should still make sense if the figure element were removed. It should be used when the content references the element and integral to the entire flow of the page. Examples are Images, videos, graphs, diagrams, code samples, -->
        </article> <!--acts as a container for any section of a page that could potentially stand alone. Examples are if a page contains indidual articles, blog entries, comment forums or other pieces of independent information-->
    </section> <!--its purpose is to group together content that is related and each section typically has its own header. It should not be used as a container for an entire page unless the page contains one distinct piece of information. -->
    <aside></aside> <!--Has 2 purposes depending on whether it lives inside an article or not. Inside an article element, the aside should contain infor that is related to the article but not essential to it overall meaning like a pullquote or glossary. When outside of an article, It acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page like a list of links, recent posts, search box, or even recent tweets by the author.-->
    <footer></footer>   <!--used in conjunction with header tags-->
    </div> <!--whene there is no suitable element to group a set of elements, the div is used.-->

## Using GitHub

**GitHub is used by amateur and professionals alike to create, share, contribute software projects. It is considered an open source version control.**

## Using Markdown 

**Markdown formatting is a lightweight syntax that is used for documentation and is great for focusing in on the "pure" content of a project. As opposed 
to HTML/CSS which are heavier formatting methods that can also be used.**

## *Some Markdown concepts I learned are listed briefely in the following list:*

Headers are formatted as follows : #H1 , ##H2, etc

Numbered lists are as follows: 
1. -a                               
2. -b
3. -etc

Bold: use **text**

italics: use *text* or _text_

just to name a few of the concepts learned in LAB01

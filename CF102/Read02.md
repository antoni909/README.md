## **This page is a reflection and discussion on Text Editor Types and why it is important for Software Developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code**

*A text editor is software that allows the user to write and edit text that can be used to build a website. According to the reading there are some major features that need to be looked into when picking what is best for the user. These features are as follows:*

1. code completion  
2. syntax highlighting 
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them 

*The article also mentioned built in text editors which are the simplist and bare editors that can be used without the perks of functionalaty and features that were mentioned.*


## **This Page is also an attempt to simplify my intial learning of the Command Line, Basic Navigation, and About Files**

Basic Command Line...Commands :

- echo $SHELL - born again shell, part of the OS that determines how the terminal will begave after executing a command
- pwd : print working directory 
- ls : list, gives plain listing of current location
  - ls [options][location] : brackets are used for optional items
  - ls /etc : (/etc is a command line argument)instead of current directory, it lists the directories contents 
  - ls -l/home/user : (-l/home/user) are the command line arguments
  - ls -l /etc : produces long listing of the dir /etc
- cd : change directory and lets you navigate the system
- file[path] : will tell you the file type

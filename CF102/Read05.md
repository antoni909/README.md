# This page is a response to the reading assigned to day 05 of CF 102 course

## The reading was about Designing Web Pages with CSS and asked us to read chapter 10 and 11 from the assigned textbook HTML and CSS design and build websites

## Chapter 10 is entitled Introducing CSS

**In this chapter I learned that CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and that it allows you to cahnge how each *box* is presented in an HTML page. A CSS rule dictates how the specified content of a specified element will be displayed on a page. A CSS rule is composed of the property and its value seperated by a colon and ending the rule in a semi colon**

**There are two ways to incorporate CSS into an HTML document, you can:**

- External CSS:
    - Inside the Head Element incorporate an <link href="location" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"> 
- Internal CSS:
    - Inside the Head Element use <style type="text/css"> followed by desired CSS

**This chapter also talked about Precedence and Cascading, noting that when there are identical selectors, the latter will take effect (the last rule...rule). Also, the more specific rule will over-take general rules (specificity over general) 

## Chapter 11 is entitled Color

**Essentially this rule allows you to target elements and apply color via three approaches**
- RGB value: exressed as rgb(n1,n2,n3) where n is some number between 0 and 225
- HEX code: is a six digit code wehre HEX values for rgb are in hexadecimal code
- Color names: there are 147 predefined color names recognized by most browswers

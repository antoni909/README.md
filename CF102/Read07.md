# **This page is a response to the reading assigned for Day Four of Code102**

## **For this reading assignment we were instructed to focus our efforts and attention to the following pages**

- *Intro + Scripts: Pages 1 - 24*
- *Expressions + Operators: 74 - 79*
- *Functions: 88 - 94*

## **JavaScript allows you to make pages interactive by allowing you to access, modify, program, and react. JavaScript allows you to access content by selecting any element, attribute, and text from HTML. JavaScript allows you to modify content by adding elements, attributes, text to a page or remove them. It allows you to program rules that collect values from users. It also allows you to react to events that you specify what script should run and what specific event occured.**

## **A script is a series of instructions a computer can follow to achieve a goal. The suggested steps are to define a goal, design the script by braking the goal into smaller/simpler tasks (using a flow chart), and create a list that completes the individual tasks in code.**

## **The following are reading notes that addresses the subject matter covered in these pages.**

## **An object is used to represent "physical" things that can have properties that tell you aboyt the object. Events are triggered when a user interacts with the computer. A method represents things people need to do with objects such as retrieve/update values of an objects properties.** 

## **Expressions are results that yield a single value and there are two types. There are expressions taht assign only 1 value to a variable and there are expressions that assign 2+ values to a var.**

## **Operators are characters (%,*,+,+, x) that allow you to perform an...operation with values.**

## **A function lets you group a series of instruction to perform a task. Calling a function means you a ask a function to perform its task. Parameters are pieces of information that are passed to a function. A return is a functions "answer".**
